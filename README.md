- Hello, my name is Madison Church (@madchurch)!
- Iâ€™m currently learning both R and Python while completing a Master's of Library and Information Studies degree.
- I work as a GTA for the Carl Albert Center Congressional Archive at the University of Oklahoma.
- I do lots of knitting/sewing and will use data from these hobbies to learn R (hopefully).
- My email is madisonchurch18@gmail.com if you would like to contact me.
- :)
